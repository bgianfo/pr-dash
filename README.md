pr-dash
-------

`pr-dash` is a command line tool which allows you to monitor the status
of all Azure Dev Ops pull requests you are assigned a reviewer of, right
at home in your terminal. `pr-dash` was inspired by the **iron** code review
system from janestreet, you can read more about that here:
[PR Dash: A command line pull request dashboard](https://bjg.io/pr-dash/)

pr-dash is currently tested on Windows and Linux.

Note: This tool is not created by, affiliated with, or supported by Microsoft/Azure DevOps.

### Configuration

To configure pr-dash you simply need to setup a yaml file with one or more
projects/repo's to monitor for reviews.

The location of the yaml file differs based on the OS:
- Linux: ~/.pr-dash.yml
- Windows: C:\Users\USER-NAME\AppData\Roaming\pr-dash.yml (%APPDATA%\pr-dash.yml)

Example pr-dash.yml:

```yaml
accounts:
  - project_name: sample-project1
    org_url: https://dev.azure.com/example1
    pat: <your-personal-authentication-token>

  - project_name: sample-project2
    org_url: https://example2.visualstudio.com
    pat: <your-personal-authentication-token>

  # Would only work on windows
  - project_name: sample-project3
    org_url: https://example3.visualstudio.com

```

Notes:
- **pat** is optional when running on windows, if it's omitted the code will attempt to use AAD authentication.
- You can read how to create an Azure DevOps PAT token [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate?view=azure-devops).

Now you can run pr-dash and try it out.
